Infant, Neonatal, and Postneonatal Mortality by Race and Ethnicity â€“ U.S.

Project Overview

This project explores disparities in infant mortality, neonatal mortality, and postneonatal mortality across different racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The data comes from a national vital statistics report and reflects recent public health trends by maternal race and Hispanic origin.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

Infant mortality: deaths under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births

Neonatal mortality: deaths under 28 days of age per 1,000 live births

Postneonatal mortality: deaths from 28 days to under 1 year per 1,000 live births

Demographics: breakdowns by detailed race and Hispanic origin of the mother
